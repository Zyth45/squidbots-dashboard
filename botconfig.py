"""Read and write the curated bot settings in the server's .conf files.

The dashboard was read-only until now. This module is the only thing here that
writes, and it is deliberately narrow: it edits the value of settings it already
knows about, in place, and never adds, removes or reorders a line.

Every write takes a timestamped backup of the whole file first.

Editing a .conf while the server is stopped needs no reload at all, because the
files are read at startup. That is the intended way to use this.
